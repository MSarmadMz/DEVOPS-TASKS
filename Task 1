Q : 1 What is DevOps?
DevOps:
  Second Name:
     "Development In Operations"
 Explaination:
          The Developer Develops A Program or Do a Code or Makes an application or invents any Software Cycle.
           Operations are performed on basis of what is Developed.
         SO,
            DevOps becomes a CULTURE, some say a Tradition means (Rawayyat) to deliver something to OPERATE on Given Set Of Instructions.
            
        
Q : 2 What is DevOps culture?
  
     The idea of creating some sort of operation and bringing it into a LIFE.
      
           By which we can execute our daily life or lifetime expectancy of solving modern problems.
           
 
 Q : 3 What are software development lifecycle models?
        
        I have studied earlier about the SDLC MODELS In My 4rth Semester Software Engineering Course.
        It says like this:
                        The Waterfall Model:
                                        The Most Traditional Way of Development In Life Cycle.
                                    DrawBack:
                                       You cannot go Back where ever You have Got a Query in your Development Process.
                          V-Model:
                                   Yeah . A better version in development Life Cycles. Parallel Commands For Development run Creating A 
                                    Bit faster but Also Complex way of DEVELOPMENT.
                                    
                          Spiral :
                                 FROM NAME : SPIRAL means a CIRCULAR PATH.
                                   Oh Man . The development within repeated steps of project , wherever you got a query catch and try it and go clear it.
                           RAD :
                               Second Name :
                                           " RAPID APLLICATION DEVELOPMENT "
                                         Developing of a Prototype of the actual model and performing operations on it for the successfull
                                         Binding of the Actual TYPE.
                           AGILE:
                                  A Flexible way of approaching and developing the process model.
                                  
                                  
Q : 4 What is difference between Waterfall and Agile model?
            
           Agile Is An ADAPTIVE PROCESS while WATERFALL Is a PREDICTIVE PROCESS Model.
           
           Being adaptive it has a wide range of flexibility and can act and operate within any condition and environment , 
           
           On other hand waterfall being predictive we dont knowhow its gonna behave and if the error occurs or any
           
           Sort of change regarding the customers side occurs we cannot handle it.
    

Q : 5 Brief history of DevOps.
     
     What does History Means:
     
              History literally means the origin of that developed operation . From where that particular developed environment has came from.
              
     History Of DevOps:
              
              Introduced by Patrick Debois in 2008 at agile conference and first Conference was held in Belgium in 2009.
