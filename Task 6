Continuous Integration:

                       Continuous integration CI is the process of automatically integrating code hanges into a single project.
                       It is a must DevOps practice. Automated tools are used to check the new code before integration.
  
        Without CI the developers need to collaborate and communicate alot to integrate their code into main.
        CI  allows  developers to work independently on features in parallel. When they are ready to merge 
        these features into the end product, they can do so independently and rapidly. The developer's 
        changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build.

How is CI used?

                  CI is generally used alongside an agile software development workflow. An organization will compile list of tasks
                  that comprise a product roadmap. These tasks are then distributed amongst software engineering team members. 
                  
                  Using CI enables these software development tasks to be developed independently and in parallel amongst the 
                  assigned developers. Once one of theses tasks is complete, a developer will introduce that new work to the CI
                  system to be integrated with the rest of the project.

Continuous Delivery :
  
                      Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes,
                      bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.
  
           Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing 
           and/or production environment after the build stage.  This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated 
           release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

Infrastructure as Code :

                          Infrastructure as code (IaC) means managing your IT infrastructure using configuration files.
                         
 What is IT infrastructure?

                   IT infrastructure refers to the composite hardware, software, network resources, and services required for the existence,
                   operation, and management of an enterprise IT environment. Information technology infrastructure is defined broadly as a
                   set of information technology components that are the foundation of an IT service; typically physical components, but also 
                   various software and network components. 
                   
 Need : 
 
         - System administrators had to manually manage and configure all of the hardware and software that was needed for the applications to run.
         - Cost Reduction.
         - Scalability and Availability.


Configuration Files:

                     Files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs. 
                     They are used for user applications, server processes, and operating system settings.
