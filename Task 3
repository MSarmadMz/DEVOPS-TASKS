 1 : What are DevOps Behaviours ?
    DevOPs:
           A cculture where the development and Operations teams collab to provide the software rapidly as per the clients demand.
            
     Behaviours :
     
     1 ) Collaboration :  Teams should collab with eachother just in case to know the progress of software in a better way.
     2 ) Consistency : The teams should be continuously improving the code and everything else for the rapid development.
     3 ) Flexibilty : The teams should be flexible enough to adapt the change asked in the development and keep on practicing new and advanced Tools.
     4 ) Customer care : Teams should develop the software considering the customers demands and needs in mind.
     5 ) Experimets : Teams should be expering every new Tool just in case for the better development.
     
 2 : What is infranstructure as Code and its Benefits ?
    
     IaC is an automate process of deploying and configuring the infranstructure servers and storage using code by development and operations teams which 
     can be further tested like other softwares.
     
     Benefits :
     1 ) Sacalability 
     2 ) Version Control
     3 ) Efficiency
     4 ) Testing
    
 3 : Continuous Integration :
            
             Software Development Process where developers integrate code changes into a repo for catching errors and bugs early in developmnet process.
        Elements :
        1 ) Frequent code changes 
        2 ) Early bugs detection
        3 ) Automated Testing
        
 4 : Continuous Delivery :
                     
                     Extention Of Continuous Integration by automationg the entire development process.
             Key Elements :
             
           1 ) Automated Build,Test and Deployment 
           2 ) Roll back and Recovery
           3 ) Continuous Feedback
           
  5 : Here are some of the key differences between DevOps and SRE:

          Focus: DevOps focuses on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, while SRE focuses on managing and maintaining complex
                 software systems.

          Goals: The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and quality of software development and deployment, while the goal of SRE is to ensure that systems
                 are reliable, scalable, and efficient.

          Processes: DevOps is centered around agile development methodologies and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, 
                     while SRE focuses on automation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

          Team Structure: DevOps teams are typically cross-functional teams that include developers, operations, and other stakeholders, while SRE teams
                          are typically made up of specialized engineers with expertise in infrastructure, automation, and reliability.

          Metrics: DevOps typically focuses on metrics related to speed and quality of software delivery, while SRE focuses on metrics related to 
                   system uptime, performance, and efficiency.
   
   6 : Organizational Impact of DevOps :
              
              1 ) Faster Development
              2 ) Improved quality of code 
              3 ) Greater Efficiency
              4 ) Improved Security
             
   7 : Cloud Computing :
                
                 Delivering of computing like networks, servers , databases and much more
                 
   8 : Characteristics :
   
           1 ) Broad Network Access
           2 ) Rapid Elasticity
           3 ) Measured Service
           
   9 : Cloud Deployment Models :
     
     1 ) Public Model
     2 ) Private Model
     3 ) Hybrid Model
     4 ) Multi-cloud 
     
     
   10 : Cloud Service Models :
       
     1 ) Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): 
                            IaaS provides access to computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, on a pay-per-use basis.
                            Customers have control over the operating systems, applications, and data, but the underlying infrastructure is managed
                            by the cloud provider.
        Benefits of IaaS:

        1 ) Scalability
        2 ) Cost savings
        3 ) Flexibility
   
   2 ) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):
                                    PaaS provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications, with the underlying infrastructure 
                                    managed by the cloud provider. PaaS provides a complete environment for application development and deployment, 
                                    including programming languages, development tools, and pre-built components.
      Benefits of PaaS:

         1 ) Faster time-to-market
         2 ) Cost savings
         3 ) Simplified development
         
    3 ) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): 
                                      SaaS provides access to software applications over the internet, with the underlying infrastructure and maintenance 
                                      managed by the cloud provider. Customers can use the software applications without the need for installation or maintenance.
     Benefits of SaaS:

     1 ) Lower costs
     2 ) Scalability
     3 ) Accessibility
